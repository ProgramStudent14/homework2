%a Create a row vector `population` with the given data
%Made population a variable to represent the data given
population = [5000, 5200, 5350, 5600, 5800];

%b Calculate the year-over-year growth rate
gr = growth rate
gr = diff(population) ./ population(1:end-1) * 100;

%Added a 0 at the beginning because the growth rate of the population is 0 at the start of the first year
grf = growth rate final
grf = [0, gr];


%c Create a 2x5 matrix
pop_data = [population; grf];
%This creates the table with Population on the left and growth rate on the
%right

%d Printing of the table
fprintf('Population Growth Rate (%%)\n');
fprintf('%d\t\t%.2f\n', [population; grf]);

%This formats the end of the table to display the numbers in a way that is
%easily readable.
